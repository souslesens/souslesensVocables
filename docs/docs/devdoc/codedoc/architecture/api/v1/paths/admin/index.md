## Overview

This directory contains administrative API routes used to manage platform-wide resources. These endpoints are intended for users with administrative privileges and provide access to configuration, users, data sources, profiles, plugins, and databases.

Administrative routes allow full control over system resources and often expose operations that are not available to standard users.

## Modules

### 1. Administrative tools (`all-tools.js`)
Provides access to aggregated or cross-cutting administrative tools that operate across multiple administrative domains.

### 2. Database administration (`databases.js`)
Manages database-related administrative operations at a high level.

### 3. Plugin administration (`plugins.js`)
Handles the configuration and management of platform plugins.

### 4. Profile administration (`profiles.js`)
Manages profile definitions and profile-related configuration.

### 5. Source administration (`sources.js`)
Provides administrative access to platform data sources.

### 6. User administration (`users.js`)
Handles administrative operations on user accounts.
