## Overview

This directory documents routes operating on a **specific user data entry** identified by its ID. It groups endpoints that perform actions on an individual UserData resource, beyond simple retrieval or deletion.

## Modules

### 1. User data execution (`exec.js`)

This module executes the operation associated with a user data entry. It is mainly used to execute stored SPARQL queries: parameters can be injected into the query, user-level access restrictions are applied, and results are returned in the requested format. Execution is restricted to the authenticated user context.
